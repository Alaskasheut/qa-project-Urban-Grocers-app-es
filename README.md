## About the project
#
I wrote this code to gain experience in the analysis of requirements, writing test cases and execute automatized test in an API. This helps to detect bugs in an API when a request POST is sended.

This code is designed to test the functionality of the field "Name" in the request "Create a kit", according with the Back-end documentation requirements. 


#  Detailed requests information for test cases in the documentation find in:
```ssh 
Apidocs    URL/docs/
```
```ssh 
Swagger    URL/api/swagger
```

## Files

|File|Description|
|-----|-----|
|data.py|It contains the data required in headers, body_user and kit_body.|
|sender_stand_request.py|This file contains the functions to send the requests for create a user and create a kit.|
|configuration.py|This file contains the URL and the necessary endpoints.|
|create_kit_name_kit_test.py|This file contains the test functions.|

## How to use
#
1. Set the configuration file:
    - Update the URL
    - Confirm paths are correct

2. Set the data file:
    - Confirm the correct parameters in user_body and kit_body

3. Set sender_stand_request file: 
    - Confirm functions for Create user and Create kit

4. Set create_kit_name_kit_test file:
    - The functions with a possitive and negative assert are set. For a possitive assert a code 201 is expected and for a negative a code 400 is expected. Also, in these functions the name given and the name registered are validated to be the same.
    - Use the previous functions to design your own test.

#
I based on materials from Tripleten Platform given for a project. This is just a functionality, there are several test objects to test.
